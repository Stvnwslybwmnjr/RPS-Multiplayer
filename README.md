This is still broken but I will come back and it wil be EPIC! The hardest part was making two players, which i got to work the day it was turned in! lol It was not a very beautiful solution and doesn't use the presence that my instructor told me to use but I got it working. I think if I just built it out i could get it working. Not to say there wouldn't be errors when one of the players disconnects... I'll deal with that when i get to it though.
